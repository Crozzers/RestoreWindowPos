VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

### Verifying the downloaded EXE

You can use the checksum package from chocolatey, or something like Python to get the checksum.

Using the checksum package:
```
choco install checksum
checksum -t sha256 C:/path/to/file.exe
```
Using Python:
```
import hashlib
print(hashlib.sha256(open('C:/path/to/file.exe', 'rb').read()).hexdigest())
```

The executable is generated using Pyinstaller and the chocolatey package is built through GitHub Actions.
You can view the build pipelines [here](https://github.com/Crozzers/RestoreWindowPos/actions).
